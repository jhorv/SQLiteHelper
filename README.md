This is a fork of andrew-su's code, with these following goals:

- Apply (what I consider) more modern code style and project organization.
- Have minimal Nuget dependencies (System.Data.SQLite.Core).
- Provide a publicly available Nuget package.
- Tests!

The original code doesn't have any license-related language aside from a line stating "Dedicated to Public Domain".  I've tried to formlize this a bit by adding the MIT license to it (if that is possible), and these modifications.

The [original CodeProject article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/746191/SQLite-Helper-Csharp) is (currently) still useful for usage examples.
