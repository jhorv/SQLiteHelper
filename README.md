This repository forks what I believe is the [original](https://github.com/andrew-su/SQLiteHelper) with these goals:
- Apply what I think of as more modern code style and project organization.
- Reduce the number of Nuget dependencies down to 1 (System.Data.SQLite.Core).
- Provide a publicly available Nuget package for full .NET and .NET Standard.

The original code doesn't have any license-related language aside from a line stating "Dedicated to Public Domain".  I've tried to formlize this a bit by adding the MIT license to it (if that is possible), and these modifications.
